# Forge OS — Claude Code Project Context

**Company**: Varsha Forgings Pvt Ltd (VFPL), Aurangabad  
**App**: Forge OS — bilingual (EN/HI) React Native attendance + HR system  
**Last full audit**: 10 August 2026

## Non-negotiable security rules

- All secrets via environment variables — never hardcoded
- Every database operation must go through Supabase RLS — never bypass from the client
- `.env` is gitignored — never commit real keys
- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` must never appear in chat — only in GitHub secrets
- Never use `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE` — use per-table DROP

## AUTHORITATIVE SCHEMA

**`scripts/FINAL_SCHEMA_02Aug2026.sql` is the deployed schema.** Ignore `supabase/migrations/20260803090000_initial_schema.sql` (old spec-derived schema — column names differ). The type file `types/database.ts` mirrors the OLD schema; `types/index.ts` mirrors FINAL_SCHEMA and is what the app uses.

### Key column names (FINAL_SCHEMA)

| Table | Key columns |
|---|---|
| `employees` | `emp_code`, `name`, `department` (TEXT), `supervisor_id`, `manager_id`, `plant_head_id`, `language_preference`, `category`, `salary` |
| `attendance_records` | `date` (not shift_date), `status` CHECK('P','A','L','WO','H','HL'), `checkpoint2_confirmed_by`, `checkpoint3_confirmed_by` |
| `monthly_scores` | `on_time_score`, `task_completion_score`, `eotm_badge` CHECK('bronze','gold'), `five_s_score` (was "5s_score" before PATCH_04) |
| `notifications` | `user_id` (not employee_id), `read` (not is_read) |
| `push_tokens` | `user_id` (not employee_id), `token`, `platform` |
| `leave_balances` | `earned_leave`, `casual_leave`, `sick_leave` |
| `advance_requests` | `employee_id`, `amount`, `reason`, `repayment_months`, `status`, `outstanding_balance` |
| `mrm_reviews` | `department` TEXT (not department_id FK), `month` TEXT zero-padded |
| `fraud_alerts` | `type` CHECK('mock_location','buddy_punching','bulk_confirm'), `employee_id`, `severity`, `status` |
| `fraud_flags` | `employee_id`, `flag_type` TEXT, `description`, `reviewed` |

### Tables that DO exist (FINAL_SCHEMA)
`employees`, `departments`, `plant_config`, `attendance_records`, `shifts`, `employee_shifts`, `leave_balances`, `leave_requests`, `advance_requests`, `payroll_records`, `monthly_scores`, `maintenance_observations`, `"5s_challenges"`, `"5s_submissions"`, `casual_workers`, `data_collection_submissions`, `mrm_reviews`, `fraud_alerts`, `fraud_flags`, `vehicle_log`, `eod_confirmations`, `email_tasks`, `notifications`, `push_tokens`

### Tables that do NOT exist (referenced in old code)
`tasks`, `hourly_production`, `shift_reports`, `salary_advances`, `five_s_challenges`, `five_s_challenge_completions`

## Employee data

- 81 staff employees (EMPLOYEE_SEED_03Aug2026.sql)
- 39 worker employees (WORKER_SEED_04Aug2026.sql)
- 120 original + 4 (PATCH_08) + 5 (PATCH_09) = 129 total once all patches run
- ~96 of the original 120 have phone numbers after PATCH_03 (includes VFL5337 fix, 10 Aug)
- **VFL1527** Sharwan Singh Jodha — phone intentionally left NULL (number given was duplicate of VFL1520)
- **VFL1528** Bhupendra Kashinath Bharude — phone +918805698127 (fixed in PATCH_05)
- **VFL5450** Sayed Uzaif Ali — full name in payroll is "Sayed Uzaif Ali Syed Altaf Ali"; confirmed same person, no DB change needed
- **PATCH_08 (real emp_codes, confirmed against contact list + salary sheet 10 Aug 2026)**:
  VFL5462 Bharat Vasantrao Salve (Manager, Accounts), VFL5458 Shaikh Irfan (Supervisor, Forge Shop, Week 3 rotating), VFL5459 Vaibhav Mali (Supervisor, Press Shop, Week 1 rotating), VFL5460 Ashok Kumar (Supervisor, Final Shop)
  ⚠ Supersedes an earlier PATCH_08 committed 09 Aug that used fabricated codes VFL5463/5465/5466/5467 — see correction note in the patch file.
- **Nagnath Kale / Sadashiv Soddy**: confirmed NOT in payroll (contact list or salary sheet) — genuine outside consultants, no emp_code exists. Not added to DB. Only add if Yash provides a real emp_code and confirms app login is needed.
- **PATCH_09 (confirmed 10 Aug 2026)**: VFL5461 Shaikh Hafizuddin Tamizuddin (Manager, Quality), VFL5452 Bholanath Das (Forge Shop QA), VFL5453 Shaikh Zaker Abdul Quayyum (Press Shop QA), VFL5457 Sandip Tryambak Landage (Maintenance), VFL5454 Shaikh Tohid Yunus (Purchase)
- **VFL5463 correction (10 Aug 2026)**: "Manoj Anantrao Wagh" is NOT a new employee — he is VFL5337, already in EMPLOYEE_SEED_03Aug2026.sql (same name/dept/salary), just missing his phone. PATCH_03 now sets VFL5337's phone directly instead of PATCH_09 inserting a duplicate VFL5463 row. Caught by cross-checking against the Rev 04 org chart, which shows only one Manoj Wagh (Electrician, Maintenance).
- **supervisor_id**: partial assignments done in PATCH_05 (Final/Die/Maintenance/Forge); rotating departments need weekly update or a supervisor_rotation table
- Salary sheet (Jul 2026 payroll template) — used as source for dept/designation/salary of PATCH_08/09 new hires; contact list (not salary sheet) is the source of truth for phone numbers — several salary-sheet mobile numbers are misaligned/shifted
- **PATCH_07 corrections**: VFL1463→Press Shop, VFL1556→Press Shop+supervisor, VFL1545→manager, VFL1389→manager, VFL1557→HR dept, VFL5447→Admin dept
- **Vijay Kumar Yadav**: removed from org chart — never in DB, no action needed

## plant_config (key-value table)

Keys: `plant_code`, `plant_name`, `plant_lat`, `plant_lng`, `geofence_radius_meters`, `qr_secret_salt`  
**GPS set to 19.836079, 75.236261 (confirmed by Yash, 09 Aug 2026). Geofence = 100 m.**  
QR salt: PATCH_06 has a commented-out UPDATE — Yash must generate his own secret (`python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(24))"`) and run it directly in Supabase SQL Editor. Never commit this value to git.

## Edge functions (6, all Deno)

| Function | Purpose | Cron |
|---|---|---|
| `nightly-scoring` | Composite monthly score for all members/supervisors/managers | Nightly 22:00 IST |
| `fraud-detector` | GPS + bulk-confirmation fraud checks | Called by app on check-in/supervisor confirm |
| `mrm-reminder` | Ensure MRM rows exist; remind managers 8th-10th; escalate to plant_head | Daily |
| `shift-reminder` | Weekly shift notify (Thursday) + daily check-in reminder (hourly) | Thursday + hourly |
| `5s-challenge-generator` | Generate daily 5S challenge via Gemini | Daily |
| `send-push-notification` | HTTP dispatcher — write notification row + Expo push | On-demand |

**Shared helpers** (`supabase/functions/_shared/`):
- `push.ts` — `notifyEmployees()` inserts `notifications` rows (`user_id` column) + Expo push batch
- `supabaseAdmin.ts` — service-role client + `getPlantConfig()`
- `geo.ts` — Haversine distance in metres
- `cors.ts` — CORS headers + `jsonResponse()`

---

## Known RLS issues (not yet fixed — need careful migration)

1. `employees` INSERT: `OR auth.role() = 'authenticated'` makes it trivially true — any logged-in user can create an employee row
2. `notifications` INSERT: `with check (true)` — any user can write to any user's notifications
3. `fraud_alerts` and `fraud_flags` INSERT: any authenticated user can insert
4. `attendance_records` write: supervisors not scoped to their own team
5. `leave_requests` UPDATE: supervisors not scoped to their own team
6. `mrm_reviews` SELECT: readable by all authenticated users (should be manager+ only)
7. No DELETE policies on any table (intentional for audit trail)

---

## Known screen-level issues (pending fixes)

| Screen | Issue |
|---|---|
| `worker/home.tsx` | `employee_shifts` join syntax incorrect; `Constants.deviceId` deprecated |
| `worker/5s.tsx` | Camera `takePhoto()` uses placeholder URL — not wired to expo-camera |
| `worker/observation.tsx` | Camera not wired |
| `supervisor/approvals.tsx` | Advance approve button is a no-op `onPress={() => {}}` |
| `supervisor/casual-workers.tsx` | Upsert conflict key uses `date` — check if `CasualWorkersRow` matches FINAL_SCHEMA |
| `manager/reports.tsx` | Entirely static placeholder — not implemented |
| `owner/kpi.tsx` | All chart data hardcoded — not wired to DB |
| `(all roles)/payslip.tsx` | No null check on payroll_records — crashes if record absent |
| All screens | No auth guard in individual route layouts — only `app/index.tsx` routes by role |

---

## What Claude must NEVER do

- Commit `.env` or any file containing `service_role` key
- Use `drop schema public cascade`
- Guess employee phone numbers
- Reference `types/database.ts` column names (old schema) — always use `types/index.ts`
- Use `shift_date`, `full_name`, `employee_code`, `department_id`, `reporting_manager_id`, `salary_structure` — these are old schema names that don't exist in FINAL_SCHEMA

---

## Pending from Yash (owner)

1. **Worker → supervisor mapping** — CLOSED 10 Aug (Yash: "that will happen in the app") — this is an in-app assignment flow, not a DB patch task
2. **Rotating supervisor update** — CLOSED 10 Aug (Yash: rotations are decided every Friday by HR/IR, cannot be provided in advance) — the weekly `supervisor_id` UPDATE is HR/IR's own task going forward, not tracked here
3. **VFL1527 phone** — intentionally left NULL; correct number still unknown
4. **Shakeel Sayyad** — confirmed 10 Aug by Yash as a real employee, phone to stay NULL. Still needs a real `emp_code` (and department/designation/salary from the salary sheet) before he can be inserted — not fabricated, per the VFL5463 lesson (see PATCH_09 correction above). Add once Yash provides the code.
5. **Nagnath Kale / Sadashiv Soddy real emp_codes** — confirmed as genuine outside consultants (not in contact list or salary sheet). Provide a real emp_code from your master register only if they need app logins.
6. **Real bundle ID before Play Store submission** — **N/A as of 10 Aug**: Yash confirmed the app will NOT go on Play Store — APK will be distributed as a direct download link to all 129 employees (sideload install). `com.vfpl.forgeos` stays as-is, no further action needed on this.
7. **EAS account for signed/production builds** — not needed given #6 (no Play Store, sideload distribution). The existing debug APK from GitHub Actions is sufficient — Android installs any signed APK (including debug-signed) directly, no Play Store signing required. Only revisit if Yash later decides to publish to Play Store.

---

## App build

**Distribution: direct download link, no Play Store.** Every successful CI run auto-publishes to a GitHub Release. Stable permanent link for WhatsApp/anywhere — always resolves to the newest build:
`https://github.com/erpvarsha-star/forge-os-trial/releases/latest/download/app-release.apk`

**Working CI path — set up 10 Aug, confirmed producing a genuinely standalone-installable APK 10 Aug:**
`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`. Triggers: manual (`workflow_dispatch` — Actions → Build Android APK → Run workflow) or push to files it cares about (see `paths:` filter). Builds `assembleRelease` (NOT `assembleDebug` — see bug list below), then `softprops/action-gh-release` uploads `app-release.apk` straight from the runner to a GitHub Release (`apk-<run number>` tag, `make_latest: true`). This bypasses both the agent sandbox's network restrictions (Azure Blob Storage, which the artifact-download URL uses, is blocked the same as dl.google.com/expo.dev) and chat file-upload limits — Claude never needs to touch the binary. First fully-working run: https://github.com/erpvarsha-star/forge-os-trial/actions/runs/31403403332

Real bugs this took to get green — all fixed in the repo, but re-check these on any future dependency bump, they're exactly the kind of thing that silently breaks again:
- `react-native-screens@3.31.0` ships a broken `postinstall` script (`bob build && husky install`) meant only for its own repo's dev workflow — `npm ci` needs `--ignore-scripts`.
- `assets/` was completely empty despite `app.json` referencing 5 icon/splash files — currently placeholder art, **swap for real branding before any real build**.
- `expo-router` declares `expo-linking` as a peer dependency with a wildcard `"*"` version. Left unpinned, npm resolves it to the newest ever published release (was SDK 57, this project is SDK 51) — pinned explicitly to `~6.3.0` in `package.json`.
- `babel.config.js` had `nativewind/babel` under `plugins` instead of `presets` — it's a preset (returns `{plugins: [...]}`), not a plugin, and Metro crashed outright with `.plugins is not a valid Plugin property`.
- `package.json` had `"nativewind": "^4.0.0"` (unpinned), which floated to 4.2.x → pulls in `react-native-css-interop@0.2.x`, whose babel plugin unconditionally requires `react-native-worklets/plugin` (Reanimated 4 only) — this project pins `react-native-reanimated@~3.10.0`. Pinned nativewind to `~4.1.23`, the last release whose `react-native-css-interop@0.1.x` uses `react-native-reanimated/plugin` instead.
- **The build type matters, not just whether Gradle exits 0.** `assembleDebug` succeeded for several runs before anyone noticed it produces an APK with **no embedded JS bundle at all** — React Native's gradle plugin only creates the bundling task for non-debuggable variants. It would have failed immediately for all 129 employees (needs a live Metro dev server). Switched to `assembleRelease`, which `android/app/build.gradle` signs with the debug keystore by default (standard Expo/RN template) — fully standalone, no separate keystore needed since this isn't going to Play Store.

Verification beyond "the Gradle command exited 0": `npx expo export --platform web` (bundles all 2671 modules across every screen/role) + a headless Chromium load of the output, confirming the actual login screen renders with zero console/page errors.

**EAS cloud build (signed builds, Play Store submission) — not set up, needs Yash's Expo account:**
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
# or: expo.dev → erp.varsha → forge-os → Builds → New Build
```
